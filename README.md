# Reversing a String in C
A string is a set of characters stored in an array, or we can also define it as an array of characters, followed by a null character. The task is to reverse the
string. In C language, there are various methods to perform reverse string.

In C programming language, reversing a string involves changing the order of its characters so that the last character becomes the first, the second-last character becomes the second, and so on. 
To reverse a string means to change its order so that the characters that were initially at the end of the string are now at the beginning and vice versa.
## Algorithm:
* Ask user to input a string to be reversed.
* Store it in an array.
* Calculate the length of the string by using the strlen function.
* Apply a for loop from (counter variable= length-1) initially and decrementing the value till (counter variable>=0) , printing the array in reverse.
